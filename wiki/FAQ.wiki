===How do I get more than 100 results returned?===
Generally speaking you should filter your result to avoid having so many results returned.  This can be done either with the hyphen-term syntax {{{-term1 -term2}}} or adding in "must" conditionals {{{+mustbe1 +mustbe2}}}.  This will allow you to spend less time scrolling through your result set looking for something of interest.  If you can't filter your search like this, you can use the {{{limit}}} keyword to return an arbitrary amount of records with {{{limit:1000}}}.  Up to 9999 results can be returned this way into the browser.  More than 9999 will go into "bulk" mode in which the results are stored on the web server as a flat file and must be manually downloaded.  An email is sent with a link to that download file upon completion of the search.
